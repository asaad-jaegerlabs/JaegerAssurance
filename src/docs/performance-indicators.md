# Safety Performance Indicators

Safety Performance Indicators (SPIs) are metrics used to monitor and measure the effectiveness of safety management systems.

## Key Metrics

### Overview Cards

The dashboard displays four primary metrics:

**Total Hazards**
- Count of all identified hazards
- Provides baseline for safety awareness

**Mitigated Hazards**
- Number of hazards with controls in place
- Indicates safety improvement progress
- Shows trend compared to previous period

**Open Issues**
- Active hazards requiring attention
- Priority for immediate action
- Tracked for reduction over time

**Safety Score**
- Overall system safety rating (0-100%)
- Composite metric based on multiple factors
- Trend indicates improvement or degradation

## Visualizations

### Incident Trends

Line chart showing:
- New incidents reported each month
- Number of incidents resolved
- Comparison to identify backlogs

**Key Insights:**
- Upward incident trend may indicate emerging issues
- Resolution rate should match or exceed incident rate
- Seasonal patterns may reveal systemic factors

### Hazards by Category

Pie chart displaying distribution across:
- Electrical hazards
- Mechanical hazards
- Software hazards
- Environmental hazards
- Human factors

**Benefits:**
- Identify areas requiring additional focus
- Allocate resources based on hazard distribution
- Track category-specific trends

### Safety Metrics Completion

Bar chart showing completion rates for:
- Equipment checks
- Training programs
- Risk assessments
- Safety audits
- Documentation

**Target:** All metrics should achieve ≥90% completion

## Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

### Leading Indicators
Proactive measures that predict future performance:
- Number of safety inspections completed
- Training completion rates
- Near-miss reporting frequency
- Hazard identification rate

### Lagging Indicators
Reactive measures of past performance:
- Incident count
- Severity of incidents
- Days since last incident
- Mitigation completion time

## Best Practices

### Monitoring
- Review indicators weekly or monthly
- Set target values for each metric
- Track trends over time, not just snapshots
- Compare against industry benchmarks

### Action
- Investigate negative trends immediately
- Celebrate positive improvements
- Adjust safety programs based on data
- Share results with stakeholders

### Reporting
- Create regular safety reports
- Use visualizations to communicate clearly
- Include context and interpretation
- Document corrective actions taken

## Usage

Navigate to the [Dashboard](/dashboard) and select the **Safety Performance** tab to:
- View real-time safety metrics
- Analyze trends and patterns
- Export data for reporting
- Identify areas for improvement
