# Risk Assessment Guidelines

Risk assessment is the process of evaluating identified hazards to determine their significance and prioritize mitigation efforts.

## Assessment Process

### Step 1: Severity Analysis

Determine the worst credible consequence if the hazard occurs:

**Consider:**
- Personnel safety impacts
- Equipment damage potential
- Environmental consequences
- Business continuity effects
- Regulatory violations

**Questions to Ask:**
- What is the worst-case scenario?
- How many people could be affected?
- What is the potential for escalation?
- Are there secondary effects?

### Step 2: Likelihood Estimation

Assess the probability of hazard occurrence:

**Methods:**
- Historical data analysis
- Fault tree probability calculations
- Expert judgment
- Industry statistics
- Reliability data

**Factors:**
- Exposure frequency
- Component reliability
- Human error potential
- Environmental conditions
- Existing controls

### Step 3: Risk Determination

Combine severity and likelihood to calculate risk:

**Risk Level = Severity × Likelihood**

Result determines priority:
- **Critical Risk**: Immediate action required
- **High Risk**: Priority mitigation needed
- **Medium Risk**: Planned risk reduction
- **Low Risk**: Accepted with monitoring

## Risk Evaluation Criteria

### Acceptability

Is the risk acceptable without further action?

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **ALARP**: As Low As Reasonably Practicable
- **Regulatory compliance**: Meets applicable standards
- **Company policy**: Within organizational tolerance
- **Stakeholder approval**: Acceptable to affected parties

### Tolerability

If not immediately acceptable:
- Can temporary controls reduce risk?
- Are mitigation options available?
- What is the cost-benefit ratio?
- Are there alternative approaches?

## Risk Control Hierarchy

Prioritize mitigation strategies in this order:

### 1. Elimination
Remove the hazard entirely
- **Example**: Remove toxic chemical from process
- **Effectiveness**: 100%
- **Cost**: Often high upfront, low long-term

### 2. Substitution
Replace with less hazardous alternative
- **Example**: Use water-based instead of solvent-based cleaner
- **Effectiveness**: High
- **Cost**: Moderate

### 3. Engineering Controls
Isolate people from hazard
- **Example**: Install machine guards, ventilation systems
- **Effectiveness**: High if properly maintained
- **Cost**: Moderate to high

### 4. Administrative Controls
Change work procedures
- **Example**: Safety procedures, training, job rotation
- **Effectiveness**: Moderate (relies on compliance)
- **Cost**: Low to moderate

### 5. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Protect individual workers
- **Example**: Safety glasses, gloves, respirators
- **Effectiveness**: Low (last line of defense)
- **Cost**: Low but ongoing

**Note**: Combine multiple levels for defense in depth

## Residual Risk

After implementing controls:

1. **Reassess**: Determine remaining risk level
2. **Document**: Record control measures and residual risk
3. **Approve**: Obtain management acceptance
4. **Monitor**: Track effectiveness of controls

## Quantitative Risk Assessment

For critical systems, use numerical methods:

### Probability Calculation

```
Failure Rate (λ) = Number of Failures / Operating Time
```

### Risk Quantification

```
Risk = Probability × Consequence
```

### Example Calculations

**Scenario**: Electrical failure
- Failure rate: 0.001 failures/hour
- Operating time: 8,760 hours/year
- Annual probability: 0.001 × 8,760 = 8.76 failures/year

## Common Assessment Tools

### Risk Matrix
- Simple, visual
- Suitable for qualitative assessment
- Easy to communicate

### Fault Tree Analysis
- Quantitative, precise
- Handles complex logic
- Requires detailed data

### Event Tree Analysis
- Shows consequence progression
- Good for scenarios with multiple outcomes
- Time-intensive

### Bow-Tie Diagram
- Combines causes and consequences
- Shows preventive and mitigative barriers
- Excellent communication tool

## Documentation Requirements

Each risk assessment should document:

1. **Hazard reference**: Link to hazard ID
2. **Assessment date**: When evaluation performed
3. **Assessors**: Who conducted the assessment
4. **Severity rating**: With justification
5. **Likelihood rating**: With supporting data
6. **Initial risk level**: Before controls
7. **Proposed controls**: Mitigation measures
8. **Residual risk**: After controls
9. **Acceptance**: Management sign-off
10. **Review date**: When to reassess

## Quality Assurance

Ensure assessment quality through:

- **Peer review**: Independent verification
- **Calibration**: Consistent rating across assessors
- **Validation**: Compare predictions to actual events
- **Documentation**: Complete and traceable records

## Review Triggers

Reassess risks when:

- Initial assessment is older than 12 months
- Incident or near-miss occurs
- System or process changes
- New hazards identified
- Control measures modified
- Regulatory requirements change
- Technology advances offer new solutions

## Best Practices

1. **Be conservative**: When in doubt, choose higher severity/likelihood
2. **Document assumptions**: Make reasoning transparent
3. **Use data**: Base decisions on evidence, not intuition
4. **Involve stakeholders**: Get input from affected parties
5. **Consider combinations**: Multiple small risks can combine
6. **Think dynamically**: Risks change over time
7. **Challenge complacency**: "It hasn't happened yet" isn't analysis
