# Hazard Identification Guidelines

This guide provides best practices for identifying and documenting hazards in your safety management system.

## Identification Methods

### HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study)

A structured brainstorming technique using guide words:

- **No/Not**: Complete negation (e.g., no flow)
- **More**: Quantitative increase (e.g., more pressure)
- **Less**: Quantitative decrease (e.g., less temperature)
- **As Well As**: Qualitative increase (e.g., contamination)
- **Part Of**: Qualitative decrease (e.g., missing component)
- **Reverse**: Logical opposite (e.g., backflow)
- **Other Than**: Complete substitution (e.g., wrong material)

### Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)

Systematic examination of:
1. Potential failure modes
2. Effects of failures
3. Causes of failures
4. Current controls
5. Detection methods

### What-If Analysis

Brainstorming session asking:
- "What if [component] fails?"
- "What if [condition] occurs?"
- "What if [operator] makes an error?"

### Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA)

Early-stage identification for:
- New technologies
- Novel designs
- Untested operations
- Unknown environments

## Documentation Requirements

### Minimum Information

Each identified hazard must include:

1. **Unique Identifier**: Consistent numbering scheme (e.g., HAZ-001)
2. **Clear Description**: What can go wrong
3. **Potential Consequences**: Impact if hazard occurs
4. **Initial Risk Rating**: Severity × Likelihood
5. **Date Identified**: When hazard was discovered
6. **Identified By**: Person or team who found it

### Optional Information

Additional helpful details:
- Related hazards or dependencies
- Applicable regulations or standards
- Historical incidents
- Photos or diagrams
- Affected systems or components

## Risk Assessment

### Severity Classification

| Level | Description | Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Critical** | Catastrophic | Loss of life, major system damage |
| **High** | Major | Severe injury, significant damage |
| **Medium** | Moderate | Minor injury, repairable damage |
| **Low** | Negligible | No injury, minimal impact |

### Likelihood Estimation

| Level | Description | Probability |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Very Likely** | Expected to occur | > 50% |
| **Likely** | Probable during lifetime | 10-50% |
| **Possible** | Could occur | 1-10% |
| **Unlikely** | Rare but possible | < 1% |

### Risk Matrix

Combine severity and likelihood to determine risk level:

```
           Likelihood →
         Unlikely | Possible | Likely | Very Likely
Critical    High  |  High   |Critical| Critical
High       Medium |  High   |  High  | Critical
Medium      Low   | Medium  | Medium |   High
Low         Low   |  Low    |  Low   | Medium
```

## Team Composition

Effective hazard identification requires diverse perspectives:

- **Subject Matter Experts**: Technical knowledge
- **Operators**: Practical experience
- **Maintenance**: Failure modes understanding
- **Safety Personnel**: Regulatory knowledge
- **Management**: Resource allocation authority

## Session Best Practices

### Preparation
- Define scope clearly
- Gather relevant documentation
- Schedule adequate time (2-4 hours typical)
- Ensure all participants understand the process

### During the Session
- Use a facilitator to guide discussion
- Encourage all participants to contribute
- Document everything, even "obvious" hazards
- Avoid solving problems during identification
- Take breaks to maintain focus

### Follow-Up
- Review and consolidate findings
- Assign unique IDs to all hazards
- Distribute draft list for review
- Schedule next steps for risk assessment

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Dismissing "unlikely" hazards**: Low probability doesn't mean no risk
2. **Focusing only on historical incidents**: New hazards emerge
3. **Over-reliance on experts**: Fresh eyes catch missed items
4. **Analysis paralysis**: Perfect is the enemy of good
5. **Ignoring human factors**: People make mistakes
6. **Overlooking environmental conditions**: Context matters

## Review and Updates

Hazard identification is not a one-time activity:

- **Periodic Reviews**: Quarterly or annually
- **Trigger Events**: After incidents, near-misses, or changes
- **Design Changes**: When system is modified
- **New Information**: When industry learns of new hazards
- **Regulatory Updates**: When standards change

## Documentation Tools

Recommended tools for tracking hazards:
- Hazard log spreadsheet
- Safety management software
- This Safety Dashboard
- Integrated risk management systems
