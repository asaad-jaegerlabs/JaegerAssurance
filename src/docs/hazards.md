# Hazard Information

The Hazard Information module provides a comprehensive registry for tracking and managing identified hazards throughout your system's lifecycle.

## Features

### Hazard Registry

Each hazard in the registry includes:

- **ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., HAZ-001)
- **Title**: Brief descriptive name
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the hazard
- **Severity**: Risk level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Likelihood**: Probability of occurrence
- **Status**: Current state (Open, Mitigated, Monitoring)
- **Owner**: Responsible team or individual

### Severity Levels

Hazards are classified by severity:

- **Critical**: Immediate risk to life or system integrity
- **High**: Significant risk requiring urgent attention
- **Medium**: Moderate risk with manageable consequences
- **Low**: Minor risk with minimal impact

### Status Tracking

Monitor hazard progression through three states:

1. **Open**: Newly identified, awaiting mitigation
2. **Monitoring**: Controls in place, under observation
3. **Mitigated**: Effectively controlled and managed

## Best Practices

### Hazard Identification
- Conduct regular hazard analysis sessions
- Include cross-functional team members
- Document all potential hazards, regardless of perceived severity
- Review and update the hazard registry quarterly

### Assessment
- Use consistent criteria for severity and likelihood ratings
- Base assessments on data and experience
- Consider worst-case scenarios
- Document assumptions

### Mitigation
- Assign clear ownership for each hazard
- Set target dates for mitigation actions
- Implement controls based on risk hierarchy
- Verify effectiveness of mitigation measures

## Usage

Visit the [Dashboard](/dashboard) and navigate to the **Hazard Information** tab to:
- View all registered hazards
- Filter by status, severity, or owner
- Track mitigation progress
- Export hazard reports
